XYScope 3.0.0 (REV 5) - 21.02.2023

+ NEWER & IMPROVEDER buildWaves() technique (added -3, to those who like previous)
+ Added Hershey Fonts (single line) w/ many functions (textFont, textSize, textAlign, textPaths, textWidth, textLeading, multi-line text, ...)
+ Added circle() + square() to match p5/Processing
+ Added steps() for multiplier of segments between points
+ resetWaves() alias of waveReset(), to keep style of clearWaves() and buildWaves()
+ XYZ WaveTables are public to grab values for other usage
+ pan(left, right) to swap pans of channels incase cables physically swapped
+ box(), sphere(), ellipsoid(), torus() 3D primitives added
+ lissajous(), to draw such forms
+ primitives can be called without params for quick test, ie xy.circle()
+ audio recorder, to save visuals as .wav!
+ lots of new demos, sharing tricks/tips from past years playing with it


* ellipse() + rect() now work with 3 params like Processing
* ellipse()/circle() fixed connecting point
* point() fixed 
* more functions accept float for random/sin play
* limitPath() improved to only draw necessary vector points
* endShape() now has CLOSE


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 2.2.0 (REV 4) - 20.12.2018

+ NEW & IMPROVED buildWaves() technique (added -2, to those who like previous)
+ Fixed Minim WaveTable bug that caused crash since REV 2 (thanks Hansi Raber!)
+ limitPath() only draw if shape within border from edges
+ Laser: RGB Laser compatibility (using 2x stereo audio pairs for RGB control)
+ Laser: stroke() to control RGB color
+ Laser: strokeFreq() to control RGB frequencies
+ Laser: strokeDash() to add dashes to RGB waves
+ Laser: spotKiller() to only draw if image bigger than spotKiller() size (default 20)
+ Laser: laserLPF() default low-pass-filter is 10k hz, use laserLPF() to customize
+ Examples: added xtra_obj + xtra_video + xtra_laser

* minor vertex() code changes
* minor changes to examples


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 2.1.0 (REV 3) - 25.07.2018

+ Vectrex compatibility (custom aspect ratio and +/- 90Â° rotation)
+ Vectrex example

* BuildWaves + drawXY to work with Vectrex mode


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 2.0.0 (REV 2) - 08.05.2018

Added/dropped/refactored enough features to need 2.0

+ Brand new drawing to waveform technique (smoother)! Prefer old way? use buildWaves(-1)
  If points matches buffer (1024), previously technique is used to maintain speed.
+ debugView(), for seeing drawWaveform() to drawXY() relationship (thanks Hansi3D!)
+ waveSize() function for dynamically changing wavetable size
+ XYscope instance for custom sample rates (41000, 48000, 96000, 192000, etc)
+ waveReset() now public incase time-step of oscillators slip when changing freq()

* Technique for adding z-axis, 
* Refactored audio out, so minim filters (lowpass) can be used, see xtra_filters example 
* Minor bugs in drawWaveform() rendering
* Drawings collect as a shapesList vs arrayList, clever suggestion by Hansi3D
* Stopped performing waveReset() on freq change, which preventing nice beam walk-around

- XYscope instance with z-axis, now has dedicated function 
- XYscope instance with int for mixerID, can change too often, select mixer by name
- addPoint(), just use point()
- wavePoints(set), new structure doesn't allow, use custom buildWaves()
- sortPoints(), was a rough test, do within sketch instead
- freqX(), freqY(), freqZ(), ampX(), ampY(), ampZ()
  now combined into freq(), amp() for 1 + optional 2, 3 values

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 1.0.2 (REV 1) - 11.09.2017

+ audioMix as instance output, enabling additive-synthesis


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 1.0.1 (REV 1) - 91.08.2017

+ xtra_syphon example, similar to webcam, load syphon textures


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
XYScope 1.0.0 (REV 1) - 21.06.2017

XYscope enters the world! 

+ Everything
